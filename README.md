## 1.1 Designing Better Buildings: Virtual Reality (VR) Experiences

This interdisciplinary research project compared VR experiences with physical building spaces. It investigated the VR user experience in building design, and assessed the reliability and benefits of using VR to evaluate occupancy flow and space functionality.

* **Tools**: Autodesk Revit, Unity Engine, Oculus Rift
* **Relevant Publication**: Windham A, and **Liu F.** 2018. A study into the effectiveness of virtual reality as a design review tool for occupant flow and space functionality issues. CONVR2018, Auckland, New Zealand. Nov. 2018. ([Link](https://github.com/fliucm/vr/blob/c748bc4b1877332696976e39d97660a88c7cfeaa/files/Paper.pdf))

## 1.2 Perception of Scale in BIM-Based Virtual Reality Environments

This project investigated how the scale of a VR environment might influence subjectsâ€™ perception of a design. It compared VR-based design reviews to physical mock-up perceptions in the scope of facility maintenance.

* **Tools**: SketchUp, Unreal Engine, Oculus Quest

The real space is shown in the images below:

# 2. Teaching VR

I have designed and taught several undergraduate and graduate courses focusing on the use of VR and other VDC technologies in the AEC industry. This has equipped me with the experience and insights on how to adopt the latest VR (XR) technologies to improve workflows in AEC.

## 2.1 Habitat for Humanity Home

A LifeVillage home was designed and demonstrated in the VR environment. It allows potential residents to walk through the home and make design decisions such as choosing interior features, colors, furniture, and fixtures.

* **Tools**: Autodesk Revit, Unreal Engine, HTC Vive
* [**Video Demo 1**: https://youtu.be/xZhgIrALEjM](https://youtu.be/xZhgIrALEjM)
* [**Video Demo 2**: https://youtu.be/z_6S-aPCHwA](https://youtu.be/z_6S-aPCHwA)

## 2.2 Exploring New VR Tools

I have collaborated with industry partners to explore new VR tools in AEC. One such VR tool, called "Visual Vocal" (discontinued), was adopted and tested in design reviews and education. This adoption demonstrated the advantages of integrating VR technology into the AEC industry.

## 2.3 Bulldozer Game Prototype

A computer game named "Bulldozer Game Prototype" was developed to demonstrate the construction workflow.

* **Tools**: Autodesk Revit, Unreal Engine

# 3. Additional Experience

## 3.1 Invited Talks

I have been honored to deliver invited talks at several universities, sharing insights on VR and VDC technologies in the AEC industry. View one of my presentation slides here: [Link](https://github.com/fliucm/vr/blob/c748bc4b1877332696976e39d97660a88c7cfeaa/files/Presentation.pdf)

## 3.2 External Collaborations

I have collaborated with industry and academic practitioners on various VR projects. For instance, in 2019, I engaged in a collaborative project with the University of Tokyo, focusing on AR technology. A prototype was made for Hololens to enhance user interactions in the real environment. The photos below were taken at a public event to showcase the prototype.
